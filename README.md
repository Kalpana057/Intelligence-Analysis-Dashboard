|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | The main HTML page for the dashboard |
| `styles.css` | CSS file for styling the dashboard |
| `dashboard.js` | JavaScript logic for interactivity and data rendering |
| `processed_data.json` | Preprocessed data used for visualizations |
| `project.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and analysis |
| `hcidata.pdf` | PDF version of the project report |
| `Report_.docx` | Word document version of the report |
